## Demo

1. After downloading the repository, visit the [NSE website](https://www.nseindia.com) to find a stock futures contract for a company of your choice. For demonstration, let's use [STEEL AUTHORITY OF INDIA LIMITED (INE114A01011)](https://www.nseindia.com/get-quotes/equity?symbol=SAIL).

2. Under derivatives, find a contract of your choice and note down the `Market Lot`.

3. Download the historical data for that contract for your desired time period, and also find the `Open Price` of the first day of the contract and note it down.

4. Open the CSV file, convert it to a .xlsx format, rename it to `Data.xlsx`, and save it in the same folder of the downloaded repository.

5. Under the equity section, locate the information icon next to `Applicable Margin Rate`. Click on it to find values of `VaR Margin` and `Applicable Margin Rate`, and note it down.

```
python3 FuturesPositionAndMarginManagementTool.py
```

7. You will see a popup requesting the necessary information you noted earlier. Enter this information and click `Submit`.

10. To use the program again, simply run it once more. Note that the existing data in the files will be overwritten, so itâ€™s recommended to move the files to another location or manually delete them to avoid losing any important information.
